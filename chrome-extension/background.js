/**
 * MonoAgent Bridge — Background Service Worker
 *
 * Connects to the Go backend via WebSocket and dispatches commands
 * to content scripts or the chrome.tabs / chrome.scripting APIs.
 *
 * MV3 Keep-Alive Strategy:
 * - chrome.alarms fires every ~30s to wake the service worker
 * - On each alarm, check WS connection and reconnect if needed
 * - Fast retry loop (500ms) runs during the first 30s after SW start
 * - No exponential backoff — flat 500ms retry for aggressive reconnection

// form's model, batch capture, the offline queue's face, and the dispatch
// that answers sidepanel.js. tables.js (CLIP-11) is absent on purpose — it runs in
