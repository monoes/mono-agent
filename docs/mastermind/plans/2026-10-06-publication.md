# Publication Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** Use mastermind-execute to implement this plan task by task.

**Goal:** Store and display profile-scoped publications with automatic capture, CLI, MCP and desktop access.

**Architecture:** A shared SQLite repository stores normalized publication entries. Execution adapters capture successful publishing operations; custom publishers register explicitly. All access surfaces share that repository.

**Tech Stack:** Go, SQLite migrations, Cobra, MCP, Wails, React.

## Global constraints

Preserve existing uncommitted user changes. Never repeat a remote publication because tracking failed. Exclude reads, likes, drafts and private messages. Scope every query and write to the execution profile. No real-account publishing during validation.

### Task 1: Repository and CLI

- [x] Create `data/migrations/063_publications.sql`, `internal/publication/store.go`, and repository tests. Define `Entry` with string fields `ID, ProfileID, Kind, Platform, Title, Body, URL, RemoteID, ParentURL, Account, WorkflowID, ExecutionID, NodeID, AgentID, OrgID, RoleID, PublishedAt, RecordedAt, IdempotencyKey`; `Media []string`. Define `Filter` with `Search, Platform, Kind, WorkflowID, AgentID, Since, Until string`, `Limit, Offset int`. JSON uses snake_case.
- [x] Implement `NewStore(db *sql.DB, profileID string) *Store`, `Register(ctx context.Context, entry Entry) (*Entry,error)`, `List(ctx context.Context, filter Filter) ([]Entry,error)`, `Get(ctx context.Context,id string) (*Entry,error)`, `Stats(ctx context.Context) (map[string]interface{},error)`. Expose `ErrNotFound`. Validate platform/kind/body-or-title-or-url/media, dates, paging. Idempotency keys belong to a profile; deduplicate remote identity within profile/platform/account/kind.
- [x] Create `cmd/monoagentcli/publication.go`, register it in `root.go`. Supply list/get/register --stdin-json/stats, filter flags and mapped exits.
- [x] Run `go test ./internal/publication ./cmd/monoagentcli` and check JSON with a temporary database.

### Task 2: Automatic capture

- [x] Create `internal/publication/capture.go` with independent input/output structures (no workflow dependency). Normalize an explicit inventory of known publishing node types/operations and successful item results. Record content and returned identity without raw credentials. Support partial-success items; rejected/error results create no entry.
- [x] Integrate capture into `internal/workflow/execution.go` and `cmd/monoagentcli/node.go`, preserving execution profile and using a unique standalone run ID. Add browser per-item hooks where final output does not include resolved content. Check legacy social CLI publication paths and integrate shared recording where they bypass nodes.
- [x] Capture tracking errors as warnings, preserving successful publishing status. Test success, error outputs, per-item content, duplicate registration, tracking failure, and nonpublishing operations.

### Task 3: MCP, assistant tools and custom workflow node

- [x] Create `internal/mcp/publication.go` and append tools in `allTools()`. Reuse repository, filters and scope. Read tools are always available; register is mutating.
- [x] Add assistant publication tools through focused handlers in `internal/ai/chat/publication.go` and minimal dispatch/definitions changes.
- [x] Register `publication.register` in `internal/noderegistry` with a schema and node implementation that accepts explicit records and context source IDs.
- [x] Update `AGENTS.md`, offline reference and agent-facing publishing guidance. Test MCP gating/isolation and registration node.

### Task 4: Desktop

- [x] Add `wails-app/app_publication.go` bridge methods calling CLI JSON. Update bindings additively, preserving user modifications.
- [x] Create `wails-app/frontend/src/pages/Publication.jsx`, API methods, sidebar navigation, App page mounting, and English/Spanish translation keys. Provide filter/search/paging/stats/detail/open URL, execution navigation, activation/profile refresh and visible loading/error states.
- [x] Run frontend publication tests and build, and compile the Wails backend.

### Task 5: Integration review

- [x] Run affected Go suites and frontend verification; inspect diff for profile leaks, duplicate remote writes and coverage gaps. Resolve defects, update coverage documentation and mark the plan complete.

## Verification result

Publication repository, CLI, workflow registration, MCP/assistant, automatic publishing capture, source attribution, profile isolation, retry/partial-success tracking, org grant classification and frontend checks passed. Browser preview used mocked publications; no live account publishing occurred. CLI default and nosocial builds passed; frontend production build and Wails bridge compilation/tests passed.

The environment-sensitive test fixtures were corrected: the cancellation helper symlinks the signed system executable, discovery assertions allow legitimate system fallback installations while checking ordering and deduplication, the missing-runtime test injects failed discovery without invoking an installed agent, and capture/coder fixtures use canonical temporary paths. The previously failing cases and the full `go test ./...` suite now pass with the default macOS TMPDIR (3,984 tests passed across 117 tested packages; 11 packages have no tests). Application runtime discovery behavior is unchanged.

Automatic capture covers native browser posts/comments/replies, Bluesky, Mastodon, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode, Product Hunt, YouTube, shared Slack/Discord/Telegram destinations, GitHub releases/issues/PRs, Jira/Linear issues and Jira comments, and Notion page creation. External code/HTTP publishers use explicit registration. Discord needs channel metadata to distinguish shared destinations from private messages; a lookup failure warns and preserves the successfully sent message's outcome.


## PR integration

Prepared on current `origin/master` in an isolated `feat/publication` worktree. Publication uses migration 063 because migrations 061 (API keys) and 062 (task board) are taken upstream. Existing MCP API tools and page activation behavior are retained. Only Publication bindings are added; pre-existing workspace dependency/generated-file changes are excluded. Coder publication guidance is added directly to current master's prompt with the turn's profile and custom database pinned, without including the separate unmerged workflow-guidance feature. The workspace-list test checks membership instead of relying on macOS path alias ordering.

The full frontend suite passes (154 files, 1,646 tests) with two workers, and its production build passes. Standard/nosocial Go builds and targeted nosocial Publication, node registry, MCP and grant suites pass. The initial concurrent broad run hit existing test timeouts; cancellation passes in isolation and the frontend rerun passes with reduced concurrency.

Final PR verification: `go test -p 2 ./...` passes on current master (5,876 tests); Wails Publication bridge tests pass. The initial timing failure is absent in the final full run.
