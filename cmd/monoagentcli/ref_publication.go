It stores posts, comments, replies, articles, videos and shared channel posts with
their content, destination, live URL/remote ID when returned, timestamp and source.

Read history (all local-only):
  monoagentcli --json publication list --platform reddit --kind comment --limit 50
  monoagentcli --json publication list --search "release" --workflow <id> --agent <id>
  monoagentcli --json publication list --since 2026-10-01 --until 2026-10-06
  monoagentcli --json publication get <id>
  monoagentcli --json publication stats

Page with a keyset cursor (stable while new records arrive; --offset still works):
  monoagentcli --json publication list --limit 100 --cursor ""      # {"publications":[...],"next_cursor":"..."}
  monoagentcli --json publication list --limit 100 --cursor <next_cursor>
An empty next_cursor is the last page. --cursor and --offset cannot be combined.

Remove a record from history (operator only; refused inside an agent session; it
does not touch the remote post):
  monoagentcli publication delete <id>

Blank out the content but keep the record (operator only; refused inside an agent
session; the entry, URL, kind, platform and timestamps stay, the body becomes
"[redacted]", nothing of the old text is kept; --title redacts the title too;
it does not touch the remote post):
  monoagentcli publication redact <id> [--title]

The MCP tools publication_delete and publication_redact (with --allow-mutations)
and the chat tools delete_publication and redact_publication do the same for the
profile they serve. They are refused after synced communications were read into
the session and inside an agent session (an org run or an agent-context marker).

Built-in publishing operations record automatically through workflows, agent-granted
automations and direct node runs. Reads, likes, follows, drafts and private messages
do not create records. History starts when this feature is installed.

Custom HTTP/code/shell publishers and agents using external tools must register
each successful publication explicitly. Register only after publishing succeeds:
  monoagentcli --json publication register --stdin-json < publication.json

Example publication.json:
  {"platform":"my-blog","kind":"article","title":"Release notes",
   "body":"Published article text","url":"https://example.com/posts/release",
   "remote_id":"release","agent_id":"writer","idempotency_key":"blog:release"}

Kinds: post, comment, reply, article, video, other. Arbitrary platform names are
accepted. At least one title, body, URL or media reference is required. Never
include credentials. Use a stable idempotency_key for retrying registration;
a new publication needs a new key. Registration does not publish anything.

In workflows, connect a publication.register node after a custom publisher.
It accepts known publication fields from incoming items or per-item config
expressions, such as body="{{ $json.text }}", and attaches workflow/run/node IDs.
Items explicitly marked success:false or containing an error are skipped.

MCP: publication_list, publication_get and publication_stats are read-only.
publication_register requires mcp --allow-mutations. Assistant tools expose the
same profile-scoped history. Org grant mode retains its existing capability rules.

If publishing succeeds but automatic tracking fails, a warning reports the failure;
it must not retry the remote action just to register history. Missing live URLs
remain missing rather than being invented. External publishing outside mono-agent
cannot be observed automatically.`)
