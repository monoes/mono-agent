// The long-lived bridge.
//
// Until this command existed the extension server's whole lifetime was one
// workflow node's run (see setupExtensionBridge in node.go), which was
// defensible while the extension only ever served workflows. It is not
// defensible now: the capture shortcut, the popup's save button, the recall
// panel and the offline queue's flush are all things the *user* starts, at
// a moment no workflow is running — so the extension spent almost all of
// its time reporting "Disconnected", correctly.
//
// `extension serve` is the missing half: one process that holds the port
// for as long as the user wants the browser wired up. Everything else is
// unchanged, and deliberately so — setupExtensionBridge already probes for
// a running server and relays through it, so a workflow that starts while
// this is up reuses it by the path that was already there.

// bridgeAdvice is appended to every "the extension never turned up" error.
// The first thing a person hit was a red "Disconnected" with no account of
// why or what to do, and the answer is almost always this one: nothing is
// holding the bridge open.
