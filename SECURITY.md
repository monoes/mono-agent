# Security Policy

Mono Agent is a local-first workflow automation tool. This document explains
how to report vulnerabilities, what is in scope, and how your data is handled.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately — do **not** open a public GitHub issue.

- **GitHub private vulnerability reporting** (preferred):
  https://github.com/monoes/mono-agent/security/advisories/new
- **Email**: security@monoes.me

Include reproduction steps, affected commands/versions, and impact assessment
where possible. We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and will
coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline with you. Good-faith research into
the security of this project is welcomed; we will not pursue legal action
against reporters who avoid service degradation, data exfiltration, and
privacy violations.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| latest release | ✅ |
| older releases | ❌ — please update before reporting |

## Scope

Mono Agent is a desktop/CLI automation platform that runs entirely on your
machine. In scope:

- The `monoagentcli` binary and the Go packages under `internal/`
- The workflow engine, node implementations, and CLI surface
- The MCP server (stdio JSON-RPC) for AI agents
- The encrypted secrets vault (see below)
- The browser-extension bridge and bundled deployment scripts

Out of scope:

- Vulnerabilities in third-party services Mono Agent can connect to
  (report those to the service operator)
- Issues in user-authored workflows or user-installed action templates
- Credential leaks caused by how a user configured their own environment

## Secrets Vault

Credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens, website logins) are stored in an
encrypted vault, never in plaintext on disk. The design is described in
[docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-secrets-vault-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-secrets-vault-design.md)
and implemented in [`internal/secrets`](internal/secrets):

- Data is encrypted with AES-256-GCM using per-profile data-encryption keys
- Key-encryption keys are backed by the OS keyring (macOS Keychain,
  Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service) via go-keyring
- Plaintext values are only decrypted in memory when a workflow runs or when
  you explicitly run `monoagentcli secret reveal <name> --reveal`

## Telemetry and crash reporting

**Default: no telemetry.** There are no analytics, phone-home checks, or
usage counters, and Mono Agent makes no outbound calls on its own behalf.

**Crash reporting is local by default.** If the CLI crashes, it writes a
crash report to a file under `~/.monoagent/crashes/` on your machine —
nothing is transmitted. Filing a crash report to GitHub happens only when
**both** of the following are true:

- the environment variable `MONOAGENT_CRASH_REPORT=1` is set, and
- the `monomind` CLI is installed and on `PATH`.

Without either condition, crash data stays in the local file. There is no
automatic network fallback for crash reporting.

**Complete list of exceptions** — the only situations in which Mono Agent
makes network requests:

1. API calls made by workflows you run, against services you configured
   (HTTP nodes, service nodes, browser nodes, etc.)
2. Commands you explicitly invoke that talk to an external service — for
   example `login` (OAuth flows) or `update` (release check/download)
3. Opt-in crash reporting as described above

Everything else — workflow definitions, execution history, the secrets
vault, CRM data, and crash reports — stays on your machine.

## Resource limits

**Importing or running a workflow is equivalent to executing code** —
workflows can run shell commands, inline JavaScript, and HTTP calls, so
only import workflows from sources you trust. To bound the blast radius of
untrusted or misbehaving workflows, runs are resource-capped: HTTP node
bodies are limited to 64 MB by default (configurable); `core.code` nodes
are limited to 512 MB of memory and 30 s of CPU by default and process at
most 10,000 items of 16 MB per item; `system.execute_command` output is
capped at 10 MB per channel (stdout and stderr). Stored outputs are
persisted in full but display-truncated at 4 KB.
