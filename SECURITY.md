# Security Policy

Mono Agent is a local-first workflow automation tool. This document explains
how to report vulnerabilities, what is in scope, and how your data is handled.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately — do **not** open a public GitHub issue.

- **GitHub private vulnerability reporting** (preferred):
  https://github.com/monoes/mono-agent/security/advisories/new
- **Email**: security@monoes.me

Include reproduction steps, affected commands/versions, and impact assessment
where possible. We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and will
coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline with you. Good-faith research into
the security of this project is welcomed; we will not pursue legal action
against reporters who avoid service degradation, data exfiltration, and
privacy violations.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |

## Scope

Mono Agent is a desktop/CLI automation platform that runs entirely on your
machine. In scope:

- The `monoagentcli` binary and the Go packages under `internal/`
- The workflow engine, node implementations, and CLI surface
- The MCP server (stdio JSON-RPC) for AI agents
- The encrypted secrets vault (see below)
- The assistant chat tool surface (`monoagentcli chat --tools` — see
  [Assistant tools](#assistant-tools-chat---tools) below)
- The browser-extension bridge and bundled deployment scripts

Out of scope:

- Vulnerabilities in third-party services Mono Agent can connect to
  (report those to the service operator)
- Issues in user-authored workflows or user-installed action templates
- Credential leaks caused by how a user configured their own environment

## Secrets Vault

Credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens, website logins) are stored in an
encrypted vault, never in plaintext on disk. The design is described in
[docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-secrets-vault-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-secrets-vault-design.md)
and implemented in [`internal/secrets`](internal/secrets):

- Data is encrypted with AES-256-GCM using per-profile data-encryption keys
- Key-encryption keys are backed by the OS keyring (macOS Keychain,
  Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service) via go-keyring
- Plaintext values are only decrypted in memory when a workflow runs or when
  you explicitly run `monoagentcli secret reveal <name> --reveal`

### File-based keyring fallback (weaker posture)

When `MONOAGENT_ALLOW_FILE_KEYRING=1` is set and no OS keyring is
available, the key-encryption key (KEK) is stored in a per-profile file at
`~/.monoagent/vault/.file-keyring-<profileID>` (permissions 0600) instead
of the OS keyring, and the CLI prints a warning whenever it uses it. This
is deliberately opt-in and still weaker than a real OS keychain's
process-scoped access control — but the KEK is no longer stored raw.

The file holds the KEK **wrapped** with AES-256-GCM under a key derived
from an operator-supplied passphrase via argon2id (same tuning as the
vault export/import format — see `internal/secrets/export.go`), in a JSON
envelope alongside its salt and nonce (`internal/secrets/filekeyring.go`).
The passphrase is read from stdin/an interactive prompt (or a chmod-600
file named by `MONOAGENT_FILE_KEYRING_PASSPHRASE_FILE`, see below), never
accepted as a CLI flag or environment variable — the same anti-argv
pattern `secret add` and vault export/import already use, since both flags
and env vars leak through shell history and process listings. Without the
correct passphrase, the file alone (e.g. leaked via a backup or a
misconfigured volume) is no longer sufficient to decrypt the vault —
unlike the pre-hardening raw-KEK format. Payloads remain AES-256-GCM
encrypted either way; the passphrase adds a second factor specifically for
the KEK-at-rest.

**Migration from the old raw-KEK format:** a vault created before this
hardening has its file-based KEK stored as 32 raw bytes with no wrapping.
The first read after upgrading detects this (the file isn't valid JSON but
is exactly 32 bytes), prints a migration warning, prompts once for a new
passphrase, and re-wraps the *same* KEK bytes into the new envelope format
in place — existing `vault_keys` rows (and therefore every already-stored
secret) keep decrypting correctly, since only the KEK's on-disk
representation changes, not its value. Set the new passphrase when
prompted; there is no separate manual migration step required.

Use the fallback only where no keyring exists (headless CI, containers);
without the `MONOAGENT_ALLOW_FILE_KEYRING` variable set, secret operations
fail closed.

**Headless/CI use:** pipe the passphrase via stdin from a masked CI
secret — never as an argument or plain environment variable:

```bash
echo "$VAULT_PASSPHRASE" | monoagentcli secret reveal my-key --reveal
```

Each CLI invocation that actually needs the KEK (decrypting a secret via
`secret reveal`/`secret get`, adding one via `secret add`, or a `workflow
run`/`daemon` process resolving `@secret:` refs) prompts for the
passphrase on stdin the first time that process touches it; further
operations *within that same process* — e.g. every `@secret:` resolution
during one `daemon` run — reuse the in-memory KEK without prompting again
(the OS-keychain path memoizes identically — see
`internal/secrets/keyring.go`'s `getOrCreateKEK`). Separate CLI
invocations are separate processes, so each one prompts once. Store
`VAULT_PASSPHRASE` as a masked/protected CI secret and pipe it into each
invocation that needs it.

Commands that *also* read their own input from stdin (`secret add` reading
the value, `secret add|update --stdin-json`, `secret import`'s export
passphrase, `jev key set`, `node run --stdin`, `jev --request -`, the
`mcp` server) never read the KEK passphrase from stdin: they prompt on the
controlling terminal (`/dev/tty`) instead. Where there is no terminal
(the desktop app, a service), store the passphrase in a file only you can
read and point `MONOAGENT_FILE_KEYRING_PASSPHRASE_FILE` at it:

```bash
install -m 600 /dev/null ~/.config/monoagent-keyring-pass
$EDITOR ~/.config/monoagent-keyring-pass   # passphrase on the first line
export MONOAGENT_FILE_KEYRING_PASSPHRASE_FILE=~/.config/monoagent-keyring-pass
```

The variable holds a path, never the passphrase; a file readable by group
or others is refused. When it is set it wins over stdin and the terminal.
Without it, a command that has no source fails with an error naming it.

Without an environment variable, the same can be configured once with
`monoagentcli secret keyring set-passphrase` (passphrase on stdin, or typed
at a no-echo prompt) — or from the desktop app's **Settings › Vault
keyring**, shown only on hosts with no OS keychain. It writes
`~/.monoagent/keyring-passphrase` (mode 0600, `~/.monoagent` 0700), after
checking the passphrase unlocks every existing file keyring; a passphrase
that doesn't is rejected and nothing is written. `secret keyring status`
reports the key store (`os`/`file`/`unavailable`) and the passphrase
file's state without prompting; `secret keyring clear-passphrase` deletes
it. The passphrase is looked up in this order: the file named by
`MONOAGENT_FILE_KEYRING_PASSPHRASE_FILE`, `~/.monoagent/keyring-passphrase`,
stdin, the terminal. Keeping the passphrase next to the keyring means
anyone who can read your home directory as you can open the vault — the
same trade-off as the environment-variable file.

## Assistant tools (chat `--tools`)

The `chat` command can expose a monoagent tool surface to the assistant
model. Guardrails:

- Tools are **off by default**; enabling them is explicit (CLI
  `--tools monoagent`; run/execution tools additionally require
  `--tools monoagent,runs`). The GUI settings toggle mirrors the gate
  and also defaults to off.
- Vault tooling returns entry **metadata only** — secret values are
  never returned to the model.
- Workflow definitions returned by `get_workflow` are redacted for
  credential-shaped values.
- Destructive (delete-class) tools write a sidecar backup of the
  affected record before deleting.
- Message content synced from connected mail accounts is wrapped in
  provenance fences so the model can attribute it.
- Tool-call timeouts derive from the caller's context, so cancelled
  sessions stop in-flight tool work.

**Residual risk, stated honestly:** prompt injection cannot be fully
eliminated when assistant context includes synced message content — a
crafted message can attempt to steer the model toward whatever tools are
enabled. The gates above bound the blast radius, not the attempt. The
recommendation is to keep tools off (the default) when chatting over
mail synced from sources you do not trust, and to enable `runs` only in
trusted sessions.

## Telemetry and crash reporting

**Default: no telemetry.** There are no analytics, phone-home checks, or
usage counters, and Mono Agent makes no outbound calls on its own behalf.

**Crash reporting is local by default.** If the CLI crashes, it writes a
crash report to a file under `~/.monoagent/crashes/` on your machine —
nothing is transmitted. Filing a crash report to GitHub happens only when
**both** of the following are true:

- the environment variable `MONOAGENT_CRASH_REPORT=1` is set, and
- the `monomind` CLI is installed and on `PATH`.

Without either condition, crash data stays in the local file. There is no
automatic network fallback for crash reporting.

**Complete list of exceptions** — the only situations in which Mono Agent
makes network requests:

1. API calls made by workflows you run, against services you configured
   (HTTP nodes, service nodes, browser nodes, etc.)
2. Commands you explicitly invoke that talk to an external service — for
   example `login` (OAuth flows), `update` (release check/download) or
   `library` (the monoes.me library: sign-in, browsing, downloads you ask
   for, and uploads you publish; the host is `MONOES_BASE_URL` or
   https://monoes.me)
3. Opt-in crash reporting as described above

Everything else — workflow definitions, execution history, the secrets
vault, CRM data, and crash reports — stays on your machine.

## Release governance

`release.yml` triggers on every push to `master`, and its `release` job
(which publishes the GitHub Release) targets a `release` GitHub Environment.
This is only an enforced approval gate once the following are configured in
repo settings — until then it is a no-op:

1. **Settings → Environments → New environment**, named `release`, with
   **Required reviewers** set to at least one maintainer.
2. **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rule** for `master`: require
   pull request review before merging, require status checks to pass
   (`test`, and the `mcp-pin-guard`/`vuln-scan` CI jobs), and disallow
   force pushes and branch deletion.
3. **Settings → Tags → New rule**: protect `v*` so a published release tag
   cannot be silently moved or replaced.

## Verifying a release

Every release publishes `SHA256SUMS.txt` alongside the binaries, and the
release workflow attaches a [SLSA build provenance
attestation](https://github.com/actions/attest-build-provenance) to every
file it produces (including the checksum file itself), signed via GitHub's
OIDC-backed Sigstore integration — no maintainer-held key involved. Verify a
downloaded artifact was actually built by this repo's release workflow from
the commit it claims:

```bash
gh attestation verify monoagentcli-darwin-arm64 -R monoes/mono-agent
```

This proves the artifact's hash matches what GitHub Actions produced for a
specific commit in this repository — it does **not** yet carry a personal
code-signing identity (see below), so on macOS/Windows you will still see an
unidentified-developer warning until that lands.

### Code signing (in progress)

The macOS CLI binary is currently signed ad-hoc (`codesign --sign -`), which
satisfies Gatekeeper's local-execution requirement but carries no verifiable
publisher identity, and Windows binaries are not yet Authenticode-signed.
Real Developer ID signing + notarization, and Authenticode signing, are
tracked as a follow-up (MA-07) pending the relevant certificates. Once
available, the required repository secrets are:

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `APPLE_CERT_P12` | Base64-encoded Developer ID Application certificate (.p12) |
| `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password for the above .p12 |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Apple Developer Team ID |
| `APPLE_NOTARY_APPLE_ID` | Apple ID used for notarization |
| `APPLE_NOTARY_PASSWORD` | App-specific password for that Apple ID |
| `WINDOWS_CERT_PFX` | Base64-encoded Authenticode code-signing certificate (.pfx) |
| `WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password for the above .pfx |

## Resource limits

**Importing or running a workflow is equivalent to executing code** —
workflows can run shell commands, inline JavaScript, and HTTP calls, so
only import workflows from sources you trust. To bound the blast radius of
untrusted or misbehaving workflows, runs are resource-capped: HTTP node
bodies are limited to 64 MB by default (configurable); `core.code` nodes
run with a 30 s default timeout (configurable) and process at most 10,000
items of 16 MB per item — an engine-level memory ceiling is not yet
enforced by the vendored JS runtime; `system.execute_command` output is
capped at 10 MB per channel (stdout and stderr). Stored outputs are
persisted in full but display-truncated at 4 KB.

## Org automations and autonomy

Org roles are AI agents run by monomind. Letting them call workflows, and
letting a model resolve their approvals, crosses a trust boundary. The
layers, from strongest:

1. **Grant rows.** Which automations a role may run, how often, and
   whether a call needs a decision live in mono-agent's database
   (`org_grants`). The org file is only a display copy: any role whose file
   write reaches `.monomind/` can edit it, so saves and the daemon strip
   grants, tool providers, and endpoints no row backs, and never create
   rows from the file.
2. **Grant-mode MCP server.** `mcp --grant` serves only the granted tools,
   takes its scope from the grant row, refuses a grant used by another org
   or role (checked against monomind's `MONOMIND_ORG_NAME`/`ROLE`, which it
   requires — an unset variable refuses the call rather than skipping the
   check), caps calls per run and per day — a cap it cannot read refuses
   too — and returns redacted, size-bounded outputs.
   It runs no engine and holds no vault access; the daemon runs the
   workflow.
3. **monomind policy.** `denyTools`, `approvalTools` (managed by mono-agent
   for `approval: required` grants and `org_start`), budgets, and the
   message fence, which is turned on the first time an org gains an
   automation.
4. **Automation-role endpoints.** `POST /org-endpoint/{id}` on the daemon's
   API. The id is a 130-bit capability, checked in constant time;
   non-loopback callers need the endpoint's 0600 credential file (on
   Windows: owned by the daemon user, SYSTEM or Administrators, with no
   ACE granting anyone else access). A
   delivery runs only after the same `messageId` appears on the org's bus
   addressed to that role, so a role that read the id from the org file
   cannot POST around `org_send`. Rotation keeps the old id for 5 minutes.
5. **Loop control.** Every crossing carries a trace; hops a header claims
   are never trusted below the recorded count, and repeat limits key on
   the target, which a caller cannot forge. `run_config`'s `max_hops` and
   `max_repeats` are read from the org file, so they are clamped to hard
   ceilings — raising them there cannot switch loop control off.
   A chain survives a trip out over HTTP and back through a webhook: the
   HTTP request node sends the run's chain as `X-Monoagent-Trace`, signed
   with a per-machine key (`~/.monoagent/trace.key`, 0600,
   `internal/tracesig`), and the webhook server continues the chain only
   when that signature verifies, recording the crossing (`webhook_in`) and
   refusing the request (429) past the hop limit. The signature covers
   chain, hop and an expiry (one hour), so a replayed token cannot lower
   the hop and stops verifying after the hour. A webhook
   body can never set the chain: the server drops the reserved
   `monoagent_trace` field and gives a run without a verified header a
   fresh chain. The token names only a chain and hop. It goes only to
   this machine (loopback, or the host of `MONOAGENT_WEBHOOK_ADDR`; with a
   wildcard bind, any of the machine's interface addresses or its host
   name, compared and never resolved) unless
   a node sets `propagate_trace`, and never follows a cross-host redirect:
   a third party holding one could push its chain to the hop limit. A
   `webhook_in` crossing takes the signed hop as is (a run's fan-out
   requests are siblings at hop + 1; a loop's return is one hop deeper each
   round); the signed hop is the deeper of the run's and the one its item
   reached on the chain. It is held to the `max_hops` of the org the chain
   started in (the defaults for a chain no org started), and to 200 runs of
   one workflow a minute (429 past that), so replaying a token cannot grow
   `org_bridge_calls` without bound: past either limit only the first
   refusal per minute is recorded. `trigger.org` runs are admitted too
   (`org_event`, or `event_start` on a fresh chain), under the same
   200-a-minute limit and the org's `max_hops`, so a loop that goes out
   through a role's tool event and comes back by a path the ledger does not
   record still climbs. A tool event that is not a granted call (Bash, file
   reads) continues the role's chain only when that workflow's own
   trigger.org run started the chain; an audit workflow is not put on a
   role's chain, and `org_event` rows never raise a chain's depth. The key
   is refused if other users can read it; delete it and restart the daemon
   to rotate it.
6. **Workdir confinement of automation file paths (C-46).** Automations run
   in the daemon, outside monomind's per-role workdir confinement. So the
   grant handler puts the calling role's workdir (computed from the
   profile root in the database and the org's `run_config.workspace`,
   never from the provider's environment) in the run's trigger data as
   `org.workdir`, under `org`, which the role's arguments cannot set. An
   automation role's run gets the sending role's workdir the same way. The
   engine confines every file-touching node of such a run
   (`internal/fsconfine`): spreadsheet read/write, write file, image nodes
   and their output folders, image vault save, email and Outlook
   attachments, Slack and Telegram uploads, FTP local paths, YouTube and
   Drive uploads, browser upload steps, and Gemini reference images. A
   path is resolved relative to the workdir, `..` and symlinks are
   followed, a dangling symlink is refused, and anything that resolves
   outside the workdir is refused with `path escapes org workdir` before
   the file is opened or any request is sent. Runs without `org.workdir`
   behave exactly as before. `org automation list`, `org grant add|list`,
   `org effective-tools`, and the GUI grant dialog flag workflows whose
   file nodes take their paths from the run's input.
7. **Autonomy.** The level, decider, tiers, and policy are enforced from
   `org_autonomy`; an edit to the org file can only lower the level. Tiers
   are computed from the grant row and the workflow's nodes before any
   decider runs, agent-written text sits inside an untrusted fence in the
   decider prompt, a decider never resolves its own request, and every
   routed item is recorded in `org_decisions`. `org autonomy pause` drops
   an org to manual at once.

**Known gaps (accepted for now):**

- **Bash.** A role allowed Bash can run `monoagentcli` with your rights and
  bypass its grants. A role's first grant pre-fills `denyTools: ["Bash"]`
  and the GUI warns when Bash is re-enabled. The org/role check in layer 2
  is no barrier to it either: grant ids are not secrets (every role's
  provider args in the org file carry one), and a role that can run
  commands can also set `MONOMIND_ORG_NAME`/`ROLE` to match a sibling's
  grant. That check catches a copied id and a misconfigured provider, not a
  role that already has a shell.
- **File paths in automation input (C-46), what confinement does not
  cover.** Layer 6 holds file nodes to the role's workdir; it does not
  hold `system.execute_command`, which runs a shell command with your
  rights — a granted workflow that passes its input to a command can reach
  any file, as a role with Bash can (the grant dialog names such nodes).
  A process that swaps a directory for a symlink between the check and the
  open is not stopped. The workdir is read from the org file, so a role
  that can write that file (workspace `repo`) can widen it — the same
  edit widens its own confinement at the next org start. A message from
  an org this profile folder cannot resolve is held to the profile folder,
  and a message from a person is not confined.
- **Level full.** At `full` a model decides irreversible items (gates,
  grants whose workflows send email or post) with no person involved. The
  fence and tiers reduce prompt-injection risk; they do not remove it.
  Choose `full` only for orgs whose automations you would accept being run
  on a wrong decision.
- **Cross-root messaging.** Orgs under the same profile folder can always
  message each other. Restricting messages between profile folders needs
  monomind with capability `org-federation`.

## Webhook trigger surface

The webhook trigger server (`internal/workflow/webhook_server.go`) binds
`127.0.0.1:9321` by default — loopback-only, same-user trust, plain HTTP
with no extra ceremony (the same trust model the Chrome extension bridge
uses). Override the bind with `MONOAGENT_WEBHOOK_ADDR` when triggers need
to be reachable from another machine (a Docker container, a VM, a LAN box).

**Any non-loopback bind is always served over TLS — there is no way to
serve a remote bind in the clear.** Webhook payloads can carry
caller-attached auth headers/tokens, so an unencrypted remote listener
would leak them on the wire. If no certificate is configured, the server
auto-generates and caches a self-signed one (ECDSA P-256, ~13 months
validity, covering `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`::1` only) under
`~/.monoagent/webhook-tls/` (key file mode 0600) on first bind, and reuses
it until it expires. Callers connecting by LAN hostname or IP must skip
certificate verification against this self-signed cert, or trust it
explicitly. For a real certificate, set both `MONOAGENT_WEBHOOK_TLS_CERT`
and `MONOAGENT_WEBHOOK_TLS_KEY` to its path/key path — setting only one of
the pair is a startup error rather than a silent fallback.

**TLS protects the payload in transit; it does not authenticate the
caller.** The webhook server itself has no built-in auth beyond TLS — the
existing pattern is workflow-level: give each webhook trigger node an
`auth_header`/`auth_token` pair or an `hmac_secret` (see
`examples/README.md`), which the server checks per-request
(`X-Hub-Signature-256` for HMAC, or a constant-time comparison for the
static header token). Anyone who can reach a remotely-bound port and
guesses the trigger's `<path>` segment can otherwise fire it. Pair this
with `MONOAGENT_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (a comma-separated origin
allowlist) if browser-based callers need to reach it; without it the
server emits no CORS headers at all, so cross-origin browser requests are
blocked outright — see [Runtime environment variables in
AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#runtime-environment-variables).

## OpenAI-compatible API surface

`monoagentcli httpapi` and `monoagentcli daemon` serve `GET /v1/models`,
`GET /v1/models/{id}`, `POST /v1/chat/completions` and
`POST /v1/images/generations` over the agent
runtimes installed on the machine (`internal/openaiapi/`). A request is a
real agent turn run through `monomind agent exec`; this section is what that
means for exposure. Setup: `examples/openai-api-quickstart.md`.

**Credentials.** A key is `sk-ma-` plus 32 random bytes and belongs to one
profile. Only its SHA-256 is stored (table `api_keys`), so it is shown once,
at creation, and verifying a request needs no vault and no keyring. There is
no authentication cache: `api key revoke` and `org teardown-profile` take
effect on the next request. A request authenticates as the key's profile and
as nothing else; a key of another profile is "not found" in every command
except `api key list --all-profiles`, which lists every profile's keys
(metadata only, never a secret) to whoever can run it on this machine.
The MCP tools over keys (`api_key_list`, and with `mcp --allow-mutations`
`api_key_create`, `api_key_update` and `api_key_revoke`) act on the MCP
server's own profile only. `api_key_create` returns the new key in its result,
once, so that key passes through the MCP host: into its transcript and, for a
hosted model, to its provider. When that matters, run `api key create` in your
own terminal and not through an agent's shell tool: it writes the key to its
stdout (also with `--json`), so whatever runs it, an agent included, receives
the key. A key is refused as the name of a key (names are listed, and one
holding `sk-ma-` or shaped like a key id is refused), and no error of these
tools repeats an argument.
The legacy HTTP API token (vault entry `httpapi-token`) is a separate
credential for the other routes: a key never opens them and the token never
opens `/v1`. Treat a key like a password; it has no scopes and no expiry.

**What a key can make this machine do.** Every request starts one agent turn
in a slot folder of its profile, `~/.monoagent/workspaces/api/p-<hash>/slot-N`
(`<hash>` is a hash of the profile id, so two profiles never share a folder;
never the profile's own folder; emptied before and after every turn), with no
tools (the functions a request declares aside: see **Tool calling**), no
settings and the workspace-write sandbox where the runtime has
one. What that confines depends on the runtime, and
`monoagentcli api models` reports it per model instead of pretending
otherwise:

| Class | Meaning | For example |
|---|---|---|
| `chat-only` | monomind's allow-list gate is the only tool gate, and a request carries no caller tools, so no native tool is reachable | claude |
| `sandboxed` | writes are confined to the turn's folder and the system temp directory; reads and the network are open, and the runtime's own configuration still applies | codex |
| `unconfined` | the runtime's native tools run as the OS user | antigravity, and any runtime monomind does not vouch for |

Which runtime lands in which class follows what monomind reports, so it can
change with a monomind upgrade. `sandboxed` confines writes, nothing more: a
runtime keeps the MCP servers and instructions files of the OS user it runs
as, so a key holder can ask codex to use any tool you configured for it.

Profiles are kept apart by their folders and by what the API looks up for a
key, not by an OS boundary. Every profile's data lives under the same
`~/.monoagent`, and a runtime that can read the disk (codex under `sandboxed`,
antigravity) can read it, the prompt files of a turn that is running for
another profile included.

The class is decided from `monomind agent scan` and fails closed: anything
not vouched for is `unconfined`. A `sandboxed` model's turn is started with
the sandbox required, so one whose sandbox cannot be applied is refused (403)
instead of running unconfined. The class is checked again when the turn
starts, against the confinement the `start` event reports (monomind 2.22
reports it), and a turn that is weaker than the listener's policy is
cancelled (403 `policy_denied`) before any of its text reaches the caller. A
streamed response is committed (status 200) on its first content or after 5
seconds of silence, so a refusal later than that is an error event in the
stream rather than a 403. A successful non-streaming response also carries
monomind's sandbox verdict for the turn in `X-Monoagent-Sandbox` (`sandboxed`,
`scoped`, `unsupported`, `awaiting-monomind`, `needs-monomind` or `off`),
which is not the class above; a streamed response and an error have none.

Be precise about what is and is not guaranteed. claude's `chat-only` rests on
monomind's design (its allow-list gate); the live check
`MONOAGENT_LIVE_API_TESTS=1 go test ./internal/openaiapi -run TestLiveClaudeIsChatOnly`
tries to make it do otherwise: it asks claude to run `ls /`, read `/etc/hosts`
and write a file. It was run on 2026-10-02 against claude 2.1.287 and monomind
2.22.0: claude did try its Bash, Read and Write tools, monomind refused every
call ("not in the tool list this exec call was given"), nothing ran and no file
was written. That is one machine and one version of each, so run it again after
upgrading either; read the class as measured for that pair and as the design
beyond it. codex under
`workspace-write` can still read files outside its folder, and antigravity
can run a shell command with the permissions of the OS user. **Run the server
as a dedicated unprivileged OS user**, with nothing of value readable by it,
before giving a key to anyone you would not give a shell.

**Exposure.**

- `/v1` rides the main HTTP API listener only while that bind is loopback
  (default `127.0.0.1:9322`), where by default every runtime is served.
  Off-loopback the
  main listener never serves `/v1`; it logs a pointer to `--v1-addr`.
- `--v1-addr` (`MONOAGENT_API_V1_ADDR`) starts a dedicated listener that
  serves only `/v1/*` and `GET /health`: no workflow, node, HIL or org
  endpoint exists on it. Any non-loopback bind is served only over TLS, with
  no way to serve it in the clear: `MONOAGENT_API_TLS_CERT` and `_KEY`, else
  a self-signed certificate cached under `~/.monoagent/api-tls/` (key file
  mode 0600) that covers `localhost` only, so remote clients reject it until
  they trust it explicitly. Set a real certificate, or terminate TLS in a
  reverse proxy. The two variables also make a loopback `--v1-addr` bind
  speak TLS, so a proxy that forwards plain HTTP needs them unset. The webhook
  server follows the same rules (see above). `httpapi` exits when the
  listener cannot start; `daemon` prints a warning and keeps running without
  it, so check `api status` after starting it.
- The default confinement is `chat-only` off-loopback and `any` on loopback.
  Behind a reverse proxy the bind is loopback, so **set `--confinement`
  (`MONOAGENT_API_CONFINEMENT`) explicitly**; it is one value for every
  listener of the process, so it also limits the loopback main listener. A
  model above the policy is not listed, `GET /v1/models/{id}` answers 404 for
  it and a completion that names it answers 403.
- TLS protects the key in transit; it does not limit who may try one. There
  is no rate limit per caller and no lockout, so a key is only as safe as it
  is long and secret (256 bits). Put a proxy or a firewall in front of a
  listener that faces the internet. There is no CORS: browser clients are out
  of scope.

**Context keys.** A key created with `--context` adds up to five excerpts
(1,200 characters each, source base names only, never paths) from that
profile's own documents and captures to the system prompt, framed as data
whose instructions must be ignored. Captured web pages are in that knowledge
and nobody vetted them, and the framing reduces prompt injection without
removing it, so **by default a context key is served only by `chat-only`
models**: a runtime with native tools could be steered into using them.
`--context-confinement sandboxed|any` (`MONOAGENT_API_CONTEXT_CONFINEMENT`)
raises that on purpose, for example to give a coding agent on your own
machine your notes. It never goes above the listener's own `--confinement`,
and raising it accepts that a captured page could steer that runtime. The same
cap decides **tool calling**: a request that declares `tools` (and does not set
`tool_choice` to `none`) with a context key is 403 `policy_denied`, before
anything starts, unless `--context-confinement` is above chat-only, because an
instruction in a captured page could steer the calls the model proposes and the
client runs those with its own authority. The
excerpts leave the machine like any prompt, to the runtime's provider. The
personal brain and other profiles are never searched.

**The `auto` model.** A request for `"model": "auto"` has TypeSafe Jev pick
the runtime and model. It is off until the key's profile runs `monoagentcli
jev enable api_auto` (which prints what follows and asks first) and has a Jev
key: its vault entry, else the server's `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, so with that
variable set every profile that switches the surface on spends it. Then each
such request sends TypeSafe, a third party besides the runtime's provider that
answers the prompt, the first 4,000 characters of the last user message (of an
image request, its prompt) and,
for every model the key may use, its name, description and validated cost and
latency. Never the system prompt, earlier turns, the excerpts of a context key
or a key. So whoever holds a key of that profile decides what is sent to
TypeSafe: enable the surface only where you accept that. `auto` is listed after
the concrete models, so a client that takes the first model of the list is not
moved to it, and its prompts to TypeSafe, by switching the surface on.

What Jev can decide is bounded by structure, not by its instructions. The prompt
goes as data (`state.untrusted_prompt`, and Jev is told to treat it so), but Jev
can only answer with one of the listed model ids, anything else is discarded,
and the list is already cut before Jev sees it: to what the key's policy allows
(the listener's `--confinement`, a context key's `--context-confinement`) and
within `--auto-confinement`, which is **chat-only unless the operator raised
it**. A prompt that steers Jev can therefore never reach a model the key could
not have named itself and, by default, never one with native tools. The author
of a prompt need not be the holder of the key (an app that forwards its users'
text, say), so letting a prompt choose the confinement class of its own turn is
a permission the operator gives, with `--auto-confinement sandboxed|any`
(`MONOAGENT_API_AUTO_CONFINEMENT`); `api models` shows which models auto may
pick and how many are held back. A model the client names itself is not subject
to it. A context key stays at chat-only unless `--context-confinement` says
otherwise, through `auto` as well.
Jev's answer is used only when it arrives within 8 seconds (looking up the key
included), with no retry, and is sure enough for the surface's threshold; an
outage, a timeout or a doubt falls back to a rule, never to a wider set: of the
validated models the most confined, then the cheapest, then the fastest, so that
an outage does not move a request to a less confined model for being cheaper. An
outage costs a profile's first three `auto` requests up to those 8 seconds each,
with their slots held; then its questions stop for 30 seconds and the rule decides
at once, and one question after that finds out whether Jev is back.
Each question is recorded in `jev_usage` under `api_auto` (counts only), and the
log line of the request says `auto=jev` or `auto=rule` and never the prompt. The
gateway blanks `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in the environment of its agent turns, which
inherit the rest of the server's: a turn that runs commands could read it.

**Image generation.** `POST /v1/images/generations` runs one turn of a runtime
from `MONOAGENT_API_IMAGE_RUNTIMES` (codex and antigravity unless the operator
changed it) that runs as `sandboxed` or `unconfined`: the runtime has to write
the file, so a `chat-only` runtime cannot make images, and the route is refused
under `--confinement chat-only` and, for a key created with `--context`, under
`--context-confinement` (chat-only unless raised). An operator who wants no
image route at all sets `MONOAGENT_API_IMAGE_RUNTIMES=none`: nothing runs, every
image request says it is switched off, and no model is listed with the `image`
capability. It is the chat turn in the same slot folder, so everything above
holds. Two things differ, and both reach further than chat does.

- *The turn is told to use the runtime's native tools.* It makes the image with
  its own tool and then copies the file into the folder it was given with a shell
  command from the runtime's own state folder (in the probes of 2026-10-01,
  codex's `~/.codex/generated_images/` and antigravity's
  `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/`), and a runtime may read its own skill files
  outside the folder first. What a `sandboxed` or `unconfined` runtime can read
  or run was already in reach of such a key through chat; here it is the normal
  path.
- *The gateway returns bytes.* Each turn is told a folder of its own to save its
  images in, `./out-<16 random characters>/` inside the slot folder, which the
  gateway makes (mode 0700) before the turn starts. After the turn, and before the
  slot folder is emptied, it reads the files at the top of that folder, and of
  nothing else, that are PNG, JPEG, WebP or GIF by their first bytes (at most
  20 MiB each, at most `n` of them, `n` at most 4) and sends them in the response.
  A key holder, or a prompt that steers the runtime, can therefore have it copy
  any image file it can read into that folder and receive it, and the test is on
  the first bytes only: a file that begins with the eight bytes of the PNG
  signature and goes on with anything is returned, so a runtime that can read a
  file can have that file returned by putting those bytes in front of it. Under
  `sandboxed` and `unconfined` the runtime reads the disk as the OS user, and chat
  could already have it say what it read; what this adds is the transport of the
  bytes themselves, of any file it can read. The gateway runs as that user outside
  the runtime's sandbox, so the collection does not trust the folder. It never
  follows a link (one planted to an image elsewhere is left out, and the log
  counts it), never opens a FIFO or a device (a read would wait for a writer),
  ignores folders, and reads through the folder's own handle, the one the emptying
  uses, which refuses a path that leaves it; a file that is swapped between the
  look and the read, or grows past 20 MiB, is left out. It is bounded as well: of
  a file that is no image only the first 12 bytes are read, no more than 64
  entries of the folder are looked at (the first 64 the system lists, so "the
  first `n` by name" is among those), and it gives up after a minute or when the
  client has left, and does not wait for a step that does not return. A copy or a
  hard link is a plain file and is returned: a runtime can make one of anything it
  can read, which is the point above.

The folder is new for every turn and its name is not known beforehand, so that a
process an earlier turn left running that keeps writing to the paths it knew (the
slot folder, or the earlier turn's folder) does not put a file into a later
request's response. What it writes elsewhere is not returned: the log line counts
the files at the top of the slot folder that are outside the turn's folder, and a
turn whose runtime ignored the folder it was told is a 502 and not a silent
fallback to unnamed files. That is all the name does. A process of the same OS
user that survives and looks can list the slot folder while a later turn runs,
read the name of the folder, and write into it, or read what it holds (the images
of the turn, before they are returned): the name keeps a writer that does not look
out, it does not keep out one that does. Run the server as a dedicated OS user and
look at what it leaves, as below.

An image turn took 40 to 105 seconds and about 40,000 input tokens in the
probes, on the runtime's own account (codex and antigravity report no cost), and
there is no quota per key: the concurrency cap is the bound. Its prompt goes to
the runtime's provider, and with `auto` the first 4,000 characters of it also to
TypeSafe. No excerpts of a context key's knowledge are added to an image
request. `auto` picks among image models only within `--auto-confinement`, so by
default none: image models are `sandboxed` or `unconfined` and `auto` is held to
chat-only until the operator raises it. The runtimes keep the images they generate
in their own state folders, as they do for any use of them: the gateway empties
the slot folder, not those. The response is written as the images are encoded,
not built in memory first, the slot is given back as soon as the turn is over, and
a client has two minutes to read the body before the connection is cut. Until the
last byte is written the images are held in memory (up to four of 20 MiB), so a
client that starts requests and does not read them holds that for those two
minutes for as many requests as it can start turns for: the concurrency cap
bounds the turns, not the responses that wait to be read.

**Tool calling.** A request that declares `tools` gives the model functions of
the caller's own. The model proposes a call and the caller's program runs it,
wherever that program runs and whatever it is allowed to do: the gateway
executes nothing of the caller's. What this changes, and what it does not:

- *The confinement class does not change.* Declaring tools moves no class, no
  policy and no check of the start event, and a `sandboxed` model's turn still
  requires its sandbox. A tool leg of any model, a chat-only one included,
  requires the sandbox too (below): the one thing tools change for chat-only
  models. A runtime that is not `chat-only` keeps its own tools in
  play, which pulled the model away from the declared ones in the spike (codex
  made 31 of 31 native attempts and edited files itself while the caller got
  nothing), so its leg runs with read access: for codex monomind makes the
  sandbox read-only (the start event says `native_sandbox: read-only`, which is
  still the `sandboxed` class; `sandbox_applied` in it only echoes the sandbox
  the gateway requested, and a write probe in the spike found the environment
  read-only). That is stricter than `workspace-write`: such a leg cannot write
  files. It does not shut anything else out: reads anywhere the
  OS user can read, the runtime's own MCP servers and its instruction files stay
  open (the spike saw codex use one of the user's own MCP servers once, in a run
  with tools declared). A model whose runtime monomind cannot run read-only is
  refused with a 400 instead of run with its own tools in play, and so is any
  runtime outside `MONOAGENT_API_TOOL_RUNTIMES` (claude and codex unless the
  operator changed it; an operator who wants no caller tools reachable on a
  listener at all sets it to `none`). claude's own tools stay denied by monomind
  (it denied all 15 attempts in the spike), and that holds only because every
  tool leg requires monomind's sandbox. Under it monomind lets only the prefixed
  names (`mcp__org__<name>`) of the declared functions through; without it a
  declared function is allow-listed by its bare name too, so a function called
  `Bash`, `Write` or `Read` would open the native tool of that name, for a key
  holder, a tool result or a captured page that can steer the call. So every
  leg (first, resume and replay, every runtime) is started with the sandbox
  required, and `monomind.Exec` refuses it (403 `policy_denied`, nothing run, the
  answer names no function) when the sandbox cannot be applied: the scan or the
  handshake failed, or monomind is one whose claude lists no `workspace-write`
  mode (2.19.0 lists only `full`). A model has the `tools` capability only where
  it can be applied, and a request that declares tools for any other is 400
  `unsupported_parameter` before anything starts.
- *What the model proposes can be steered, and for the client's own functions the
  caller decides.* A tool result is untrusted data. The prompt fences it
  (`<function_result>`): the fence is the defence, a model is told that what is
  inside is data. A second layer defangs the fence's tags and any line of a result
  that would open a turn of the transcript, so a result does not pass for the
  user's or the assistant's words, and it reads the result as a model does, not as
  an ASCII pattern does: every character a renderer may end a line at (CR, VT, FF,
  the information separators, NEL, the line and paragraph separators) ends one,
  every kind of space is a space, case does not matter, a look-alike of an ASCII
  character (full-width, bold, circled or superscript letters, full-width
  brackets, ligatures: NFKD) is that character, a letter with a diacritic is the
  letter (precomposed or written apart: `[üser]` is `[user]`), a Unicode tag character
  (U+E0000 to U+E007F, which renders as nothing and which a model may read as the
  ASCII character it is the twin of: "ASCII smuggling") is that character, and
  whatever renders as nothing (control and format characters, the Hangul and
  braille blanks, combining marks) is not there, so spelling a marker or a tag
  with them gains nothing against a reader of that kind (a fuzz of random
  compositions of them, judged by a reader written the other way round, is in the
  tests: that judge calls none of the code, but it shares with it Unicode's
  tables, `unicode.IsSpace`, NFKD and the model of deleting everything that is not
  a letter, a digit, a space or ASCII, so a wrong belief of that model is a blind
  spot of both; a corpus of code, documentation and logs that must come out
  unchanged grades the other direction). A match is neutralised in place and
  nothing else of a result is changed: line ends of every kind reach the model as
  they were (a file with CRLF line ends is read as it is), and so does everything
  that only looks like a marker or a tag. A role marker is a role word in brackets
  at the start of a line, with spaces allowed around the word, or the header of a
  result, `[tool NAME (ID)]`: `[tool.poetry]`, `[User guide](url)`,
  `[tool for tool in tools]` and `[ user = root ]` are text, while the `[user]`
  header of a gitconfig is indistinguishable from a marker and is defanged with the
  rest. A fence tag spelled as the fence spells it (with an underscore) is one
  wherever it stands and whatever follows it, so `List<function_result>` is
  changed too; the spellings a reader folds into it (camel case, no underscore)
  are one only as a closing tag, where the name ends (`Promise<FunctionResult>`,
  `i < functionResult.length` and `</FunctionResultList>` are text,
  `</functionResult>` is not).
  The arguments of a call that a client sends back, which the transcript renders
  outside the fence, are rendered as compact JSON (with the characters that end a
  line escaped) or, when they are not JSON, defanged as a result is; the name
  of such a call is refused (400) unless it is printable ASCII without
  `[ ] < > & ' "` or a backtick. An id of that kind is shown as it is, and any
  other id (a client may send one of 1 to 128 bytes of anything) is shown to the
  model as `call_1`, `call_2`, ... in order of appearance, never as sent: the
  transcript is the only place an id is shown, and a session is resumed only for
  the id the gateway made, which is such a token. The second layer does not look
  through a letter that only resembles a Latin one and is not one with a mark or
  a case of one (a Cyrillic "е", a Greek omicron, a small capital "ᴜ"), which would
  take a table of confusables: against such a disguise the fence is the defence.
  The words of the
  user are rendered as the client sent them (they are the conversation). The words
  an assistant said before a call are not: a result can steer what a model says,
  and the client sends it back, so in a replay (a conversation with tool history,
  whether or not tools are still offered) they are defanged as a result is, and
  are not fenced (a conversation without tools is rendered as it always was).
  The tags of the fence carry no per-request token. The
  knowledge excerpts of a context key have their own, narrower defence: only
  their `<knowledge` tags are defanged.
  None of that keeps a model from following what a result says: a tool that
  fetched a web page can return instructions, and a key created with `--context`
  puts excerpts of captured pages in the system prompt. Either can steer which
  calls the model proposes next, so a context key is refused tools unless the
  operator raised `--context-confinement` (and, on a chat-only listener,
  `--confinement`: the key is held to the lower of the two) above chat-only (403
  `policy_denied`, before anything starts; a result is still untrusted data on
  any other key). The gateway cannot tell a steered call from an asked one, and it
  returns every call monomind lets through, valid or not: monomind rejects a call
  whose top-level types, string enums or required names do not match what it was
  told (such a call never comes back), and one that does not match the rest of its
  schema is returned too and counted in the log. So a client that runs calls without asking runs whatever
  the model was steered to propose, with its own permissions: give such a client
  keys whose prompts you trust, and keep a person, or a policy of the client's
  own, between a call and its execution.
- *Not every call is the client's.* What the caller decides is its own functions.
  A codex leg may use a tool of one of the user's own MCP servers (the spike saw
  it once): the runtime makes that call itself, the gateway never sees it as a
  call to return, the read-only sandbox of the leg does not cover it (it limits
  what the runtime writes, not which servers it talks to) and the caller does not
  decide it, so a steered model can reach it without the client. A leg in which
  such a tool ran is never replayed or given back (so it does not run twice), but
  it ran once. An operator who does not want that removes those servers from
  codex's configuration, or leaves codex out of `MONOAGENT_API_TOOL_RUNTIMES`
  (claude's own tools are denied by monomind, which is stricter).
- *What is kept.* No process waits for a result and no slot is held while the
  client runs the call. A continuation record (the id the client was given, key
  id, profile, model, function name, a hash of the declared tools, a hash of the
  conversation the leg was given, a hash of the call's arguments and the
  runtime's session id) lives in memory
  for ten minutes, at most 1,024 in all and 64 per key, and is used once (given
  back, with the expiry it had, only when a resume fails before the model ran, for
  a rate limit, the quota or a sign-in, and no tool of the runtime's own had
  run: such a tool is never run a second time by a replay or a retry, and a
  retry does not extend how long a session lives); a restart loses them and the follow-ups then start from their
  transcripts. It holds no argument and no result, and a follow-up continues the
  session only when its conversation before the call hashes the same. A record belongs to
  its key: another key, even of the same profile, finds nothing and is served by
  replaying the transcript it sends, and a revoked key cannot authenticate at all.
  The session id comes from the record, never from the client. The agent CLIs
  keep the sessions they resumed or cancelled in their own stores, which hold the
  arguments and results of every leg, as they hold prompts (see below).
- *Logs and errors.* The line of a request with tools adds how many tools it
  declared and how its leg started (`tools=<n> leg=first|resume|replay`, and
  `badargs=1` when a call did not match its schema). It never holds a function
  name, an argument or a result, and an error sent to the caller names a
  parameter, never what the client put in it, and never echoes a tool result.
- *A cancelled leg's runtime can outlive it a few seconds.* A leg ends by
  cancelling its turn: monomind's cancel for claude, SIGTERM to the process group
  for codex, and a group kill only if monomind has not exited within its grace.
  The slot's folder is emptied and the slot freed when Exec returns, not when the
  runtime's process is gone, and in the live check claude's own binary outlived
  a cancelled leg by about 5 s, an orphan of monomind that exited by itself (codex
  left nothing). For those seconds a process of the cancelled leg still has the
  slot's folder as its working directory. A freed slot joins the back of the
  queue, so with the default four another request takes that folder only after
  three others have been served, and `--max-concurrent 1` makes it the next one;
  a turn starts in an emptied folder, and the process wrote nothing there in the
  live check. It is the same runtime under the same confinement, so no policy is
  crossed; a runtime that hung would not be killed, which is a matter for
  `monomind.Exec`.
- *Reliability, not security.* A resumed leg can ask for the same call again
  instead of using the result: 1 of 19 single-result claude legs did in the
  spike, 0 of 18 on codex, and nothing detects it. codex repeats an identical
  call two or three times within a leg (7 of 16 legs): the leg ends at the first
  and ignores the repeats. A client whose tool has a side effect (a write, a
  send) should make it idempotent, or look at a call identical to the last it
  ran before running it again. Neither crosses a boundary; both are why side
  effects the client cannot take back deserve a look first.
- *Cost.* Every leg is a real turn, and a loop of N calls is N + 1 of them, each
  on the runtime's account; a leg that cannot continue a session pays for the
  whole transcript again (a resumed leg cost about half of a replayed one on
  claude in the spike). There is no limit on the rounds of a client's loop and no
  quota per key: the concurrency cap, the body size and the turn timeout are the
  bounds, as for chat. A response carries one call, so a model that wants several
  asks for them in successive rounds.

**Cost and abuse limits.** There are no per-key quotas: every request is a real
model turn on your subscription or account, and some runtimes report no cost
(for what an image turn took, see above).
The bound is the concurrency cap (4 turns, 429 beyond it; `--max-concurrent`),
the 2 MiB request body (64 KiB for an image request) and the 10 minute turn
timeout. A request that is
rejected (invalid, over policy, or busy) starts nothing and takes no slot.

**Logs and errors.** One line per chat completion or image request names the
request id, key
id, profile, model, status, duration, how many knowledge excerpts were
added (chat only) and, for `auto`, who chose the model, plus, for a failure, the
operator-only detail (a Go error or a
runtime's error code; for an image request, whether it made images or not, how
many of the files it looked at the collection left out and why, never a file
name). A failure to list models, a failed knowledge search and
a failure to verify a key are logged too; a successful listing is not. None
of the gateway's lines holds a prompt, an answer or a key. monomind's own
diagnostics (its stderr) reach the server log as they do for any use, and
nothing in this repo shows that they never echo a prompt. A failed
authentication is logged with the address of the connection, never the key it
sent (behind a reverse proxy that is the proxy's address: `X-Forwarded-For` is
not read); a request that sent no credential at all is not logged. Error
messages sent to callers are generic for internal failures and for a runtime
error other than a setup hint, a rate limit, quota or a timeout; of those,
only the part monomind classified reaches the caller, on one line and at most
300 characters. The one other place a runtime's words reach the caller is the
502 of an image request whose turn made no image: what the runtime replied, on
one line and at most 300 characters, the answer to the caller's own prompt.
Every response of the four routes carries an `X-Request-Id`
to quote to the operator. A path or method the API does not have gets Go's
plain-text 404 or 405, without one. `GET /health` on the dedicated listener is
unauthenticated and returns the server version.

**What this does not cover.**

- Revocation applies to the next request: a turn already running finishes,
  within the turn timeout. Stopping the daemon or `httpapi` ends the turns in
  flight (their clients get a 503 they can retry) and waits for their
  processes to be killed, up to a few seconds longer than monomind's kill grace
  when a second Ctrl+C forces the exit, so that no agent CLI outlives the
  command. `httpapi` and a dedicated listener first give running requests 10
  seconds to finish; the daemon's main listener does not.
- The agent CLIs keep session transcripts of their turns in their own stores
  (claude's `~/.claude/projects/<folder>`), prompts and answers included, as
  they do for any use, and the arguments and results of the tool calls of a
  conversation with tools. The fixed slot folders keep the number of those
  folders bounded (one per profile and slot), not their content, and keep
  one profile's apart from another's.
- Some runtimes (antigravity) pass the prompt on their command line, which
  other local users can read with `ps` while the turn runs. So does a context
  key's knowledge search, for every runtime, claude included: it runs
  `monomind mcp exec -t knowledge_search` with the first 500 characters of the
  last user message in its arguments, for up to 30 seconds, in two parallel
  processes (documents and captures). On a shared host, run the server on a
  machine or an OS user of its own.
- A turn's prompt and system prompt (which carry a context key's excerpts) are
  written to files in a private folder (mode 0700) under
  `~/.monoagent/workspaces/api/.tmp`, outside every turn's writable area, and
  removed when the turn ends (a crash leaves them until the next start, which
  clears the folder). The mode keeps other OS users out, not other turns: a
  runtime that can read the disk can read them while the turn runs, another
  profile's included, and an unconfined runtime can write there.
- monomind keeps copies of its own: its hermes, cline and kimicode runners write
  the prompt, or an agent file, under the temp directory and hand the CLI its
  path. A sandboxed turn can write the system temp directory and `/tmp`
  (checked with codex's `workspace-write` on macOS), so it could rewrite such a
  copy before it is read. Each API turn therefore gets a temp directory of its
  own (`TMPDIR`, `TMP` and `TEMP`), a folder inside its own folder that no other
  turn's sandbox reaches, emptied with the rest of the turn's files. That
  protects the turns of the API, and only those. A turn that does not come
  through it (a workflow, a chat) keeps monomind's copies in the system temp
  directory, and a sandboxed API turn can still write `/tmp`: where that is the
  temp directory (Linux), it could rewrite such a turn's prompt file. On a host
  that also runs hermes, cline or kimicode turns as the same OS user, run the
  API server as a user of its own, or with `--confinement chat-only`. The files
  `monomind.Exec` itself makes for every other caller go to `~/.monoagent/tmp`
  (mode 0700, files older than a day swept), or to the system temp directory
  when that folder cannot be made.
- A runtime can leave a process behind it (a command started with `nohup`, say)
  that keeps its write access to the turn's folder. Emptying the folder does
  not stop it. For an image turn a process that keeps writing where it wrote
  before cannot put a file into a later request's response, which is read from a
  folder with a name it did not know in advance; one that looks (lists the slot
  folder, reads the name) can still read and write whatever that folder holds
  while the turn runs, as a process of the same OS user (see Image generation). A sandbox that only confines writes below the turn's folder
  (macOS's, checked) still lets the turn remove that folder and put a link in
  its place. The gateway looks at the folder from its parent, which no turn can
  change, and acts on it through open handles: a link is set aside, not
  followed, so neither such a process nor such a turn can send the emptying
  outside the folder. A folder it makes impossible to empty (a tree deeper
  than 100 levels), or too slow to (more than 30 seconds: it keeps changing the
  tree, or swaps a directory for a FIFO that the walk then waits on) is moved to
  `~/.monoagent/workspaces/api/.quarantine` and replaced. A walk that was given
  up on is not waited for; one stuck on a FIFO holds a thread and a few file
  descriptors until the server restarts. Nothing ends the process. Run the server as a dedicated OS user and
  look at what it leaves.
- Where a turn's sandbox is rooted is a path: the turn's folder. A process that
  outlives its turn can replace that folder with a link in the moment between
  the gateway's last look at it and the start of the next turn of the slot, and
  that turn's sandbox is then rooted where the link points, an OS user's home
  included. The gateway looks right before it starts the process, which narrows
  the window to milliseconds and cannot close it: only a runtime that roots its
  sandbox on an open directory could. Read `sandboxed` as confining a prompt,
  not a determined key holder, and keep the OS user's own files out of reach (a
  dedicated user, as above).

**Not part of this surface.** Running a caller's tool: the gateway returns the
call and the caller runs it. The runtime's own native tools are a separate matter,
covered by the classes above.
