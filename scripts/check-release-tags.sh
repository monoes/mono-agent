# (spec D11, D24): devaccount trusts a development signing key anyone can sign with, releasee2e pins
# a test update key and redirects the update client to a loopback server. It reads the build settings every
# Go binary carries (`go version -m`), whatever OS it was built for.

# A folder is searched; a .tar.gz, .tgz or .zip is unpacked and searched too, so the desktop app's
# executable and the CLI bundled with it are covered. Files that are not executables are ignored;
# a file that looks like an executable (ELF, Mach-O, PE magic) but has no readable Go build info is
# an error unless its base name was passed with --allow-non-go NAME (repeatable).
# --min N fails when fewer than N Go binaries were found, so a release whose layout changed cannot
# pass by checking nothing.
