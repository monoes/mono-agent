// StartRefresher starts the background refresher: it follows session.json,
// tells OnRefused callbacks about a refusal, and refreshes at half the token's
// lifetime, retrying a failure with a backoff of 30 seconds doubling to 5
// minutes. It is idempotent, does nothing while the package is dormant (spec
// D22) and ends when ctx ends or the guard is closed, after a grant in flight is
// answered and stored: a grant once sent is never abandoned (A20), so the end of
// ctx and Close wait for it, for at most the grant's timeout and the key store
// write that follows. The daemon is to start it at once and any other process after
// LateRefresher (B3a and B2 write those calls).
//
// A guard starts one loop in its life. A loop that has ended with its ctx leaves
// loopCancel set, so every later call is a no-op and the ctx of the first call
// decides how long the refresher runs: callers must pass a ctx that lives as long
// as the process.

		// went back: the loop that holds keeps the high-water mark current, so a clock
		// corrected after that lies before the mark and is locked, and one refresh,
		// which the corrected clock and monoes.me agree on, repairs it; nothing in
		// this process would before the clock came round to the mark again.
		//
		// A marker is on a clock: monoes.me repeats its answer for 300 s and the guard drops
		// the token after pendingRetryWindow, so waiting out a hold of half an hour or a
		// backoff of five minutes would lose a token that a retry still recovers. No hold
		// keeps a pass off while there is one. One that another process left (a CLI whose
		// answer was lost while this loop held after a refresh or waited out a backoff) also
		// caps the wait at backoffMin. A marker that the loop follows, its own or one it has
		// retried, keeps the backoff, which starts again at backoffMin for each new marker,
		// so that its retries at +30, +90 and +210 s are inside the window.
