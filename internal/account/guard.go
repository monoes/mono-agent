// TokenSet is what a refresh-token grant returns.
type TokenSet struct{ AccessToken, RefreshToken string }

// Refresher performs the OAuth refresh-token grant with resource=Audience. It
// returns *RefusedError only when monoes.me answered invalid_grant (spec D27)
// and *TransientError for every other failure. B1b implements it; a Guard
// without one never refreshes.
//
// The guard calls Refresh with a context that is NOT cancelled when the caller
// of EnsureFresh or Refresh gives up (Ctrl-C, a signal, a deadline, the guard
// closing), and whose deadline is refreshCallTimeout (20 s) from the call. The
// server rotates the refresh token as it answers, so a request that is dropped
// after it was sent loses the new token and leaves a dead one on disk, which
// the server takes for theft the next time it is presented. A Refresher must
// therefore not rely on its caller's cancellation, and must let its request run
// to its answer or to that deadline.
//
// A *TransientError says whether the outcome of the grant is known (Settled): true
// only when the request never left this machine or monoes.me answered with an HTTP
// status, so that the refresh token cannot have been consumed by an answer nobody
// saw. Anything else, a *TransientError that does not say included, is an outcome
// that is unknown, and the guard then treats the refresh token as one that monoes.me
// may have rotated: it keeps a marker (Session.PendingSince), presents the token
// again at once for pendingRetryWindow, while monoes.me repeats its answer, and drops
// it after that, so that this machine signs in again and the other installs of the
// account are not revoked (A24).
//
// Two rules the guard relies on. On any error, return a nil *TokenSet: a set
// returned beside an error is ignored, so a rotated refresh token in it is lost.
// And never return a typed-nil error, a nil *RefusedError or *TransientError
// stored in an error: the guard reads it as no error at all, so a token set that
// comes with it is a success and none is a server error, never a refusal. One
// that another error wraps is not seen through: an ordinary unreachable failure.
