// The bridge's self-description, served unauthenticated at
// /monoagent/health.
//
// Three different situations used to look identical from the browser's
// side — the extension could only report "Disconnected" and leave the user
// to guess which one they were in:
//
//   - nothing is listening at all (no bridge process): the HTTP request
//     fails outright, and FetchStatus says so;
//   - something is listening but it is not us (most often a Chrome started
//     with --remote-debugging-port=9222, which answers on that port and
//     404s this path): Service is absent, and FetchStatus rejects it;
//   - the bridge is up but this extension is not paired with it: Status is
//     StatusUnpaired.
//
// Everything here is already public to any same-machine caller — the port,
// whether a socket is attached, the process id — so no secret is added to
// an endpoint that deliberately has no auth on it. In particular the
// pairing token never appears: an unauthenticated endpoint that hands out
// the credential would make pairing pointless.

// ServiceName marks a response as coming from this bridge and nothing
// else. Callers that probe a port treat its absence as "not the bridge".

// turn each one into a different sentence for the user, and a state nobody
// can phrase is a state nobody can act on.

	// whose service worker has been suspended — it reconnects on the next
	// event.
