// The CDP relay: raw Chrome DevTools Protocol over the extension bridge.
//
// The extension already holds Chrome's `debugger` permission and already
// speaks CDP to the user's real, logged-in tabs (see the eval_cdp/type_cdp
// commands in chrome-extension/background.js, and cdp_proxy.js which
// generalises them). What was missing was a way for something *outside* this
// process to drive that — specifically monobrowse, whose every instrument
// (console, network, HAR, vitals, trace, CPU profiler, snapshot, screenshot,
// emulation) is written against a CDP client and none of which should have
// to be ported per backend.
//
// So: one WebSocket endpoint that carries CDP envelopes to the extension and
// fans debugger events back. It deliberately knows nothing about CDP itself —
// framing, ids, sessions and timeouts all live in monobrowse's bridge
// transport (packages/@monoes/monobrowse/src/browser/bridge.ts). This side is
// a relay, and a relay that parsed CDP would be a second implementation to
// keep in sync.
//
// One thing it enforces, and it is the only boundary here: the same token
// as /monoagent/relay. This socket reaches a browser the user is signed
// into; it is not a public port, and the token is what keeps it off one.
//
// It also accepts only the three cdp_* envelope types — be precise about
// what that buys, because the shape of the check invites a stronger reading
// than it deserves. It keeps this endpoint from becoming a second path to
// the extension's OWN commands (get_cookies, eval, page_capture), which
// have their own handling and audit trail on the general relay. It does
// NOT narrow what CDP itself can do: the extension side forwards whatever
// `method` an envelope names, with no allowlist (chrome-extension/
// cdp_proxy.js), so anything holding the token can call Runtime.evaluate or
// Network.getAllCookies through here and get exactly what it asked for —
// which is by design, since the point is to run monobrowse's instruments
// unmodified, and those speak the whole protocol.
//
// So: a routing gate, not a confinement boundary. Anyone reasoning about
// what a compromised relay client can reach should reason about the token
// and about chrome.debugger, not about this list of three.
