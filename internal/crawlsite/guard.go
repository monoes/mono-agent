// connection it makes: the host is one the crawl was told to walk, and the
// address behind that host is on the public internet. The scope check
// answers the first. This file answers the second, and it does it at the
// dial, which is the only place that sees the address DNS actually
// returned — a name that resolves to 169.254.169.254, or one that resolves
// differently the second time it is asked (DNS rebinding), gets past every
// check made on the URL alone.
