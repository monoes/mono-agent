// waiting through that with the generic "Waiting for response" label and
// the "No new activity for Ns" idle warning would tell the user something
// might be stuck when nothing is wrong — that turn was never going to show
// partial output. Defaults to `true` (today's behavior, honest for a
// streaming-capable runtime) so old data, mocks, and any caller not
// passing it are unaffected — only an explicit `false` changes anything,
