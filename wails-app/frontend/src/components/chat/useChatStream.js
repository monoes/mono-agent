// fetch, no live merge, no subscription) rather than observing a live one.
// Used by AIChatPanel.jsx's loadConversation to rebuild each past turn's
// state before feeding it to the same ChatTimeline/TurnStatus components a
// live turn (via useChatStream above) uses.

// Replays one turn's already-fetched events through chatReducer to
// reconstruct its final state — used for history (a past turn's events,
// fetched once) rather than live streaming (this file's own useChatStream
// hook owns that). No scope is set: the caller already fetched precisely
// one turn's events via getChatEvents(conversationId, turnId, ...), so
// every event necessarily belongs here. The result is fed straight into
// ChatTimeline/TurnStatus — the same components a live turn uses — so a
// reopened past turn renders identically to how it looked while it was

// turn that produced nothing at all and never reached a terminal status
// (defensively skipped rather than shown as a blank turn).
//
// That skip must NOT apply to a turn that is active because it is
// genuinely still running in a DIFFERENT live instance (GetChatTurns'
// ownedByThisInstance:false — see
// docs/mastermind/plans/2026-09-12-interactive-agent-chat-followups.md,
// "OwnerInstanceID is written and read back but never compared to
// anything"): turn.started alone adds no part, so a foreign turn that has
// only just been admitted elsewhere (routine while its subprocess launches
// or its model connects) has exactly the zero-parts shape this skip was
// meant for a DIFFERENT case (this instance's own turn, just admitted, no
// events yet) — silently dropping it here would hide it entirely, right as
// this window's own next send() in that same conversation gets refused
// (ErrTurnOwnedByOtherInstance), with nothing on screen explaining why.
// Same principle the live-turn finalize path already applies (see its own
// comment in AIChatPanel.jsx: "Pushed even when parts is empty: TurnStatus
// alone still truthfully reports a silent failure/stop rather than hiding
// it") — an empty ChatTimeline plus the honest static TurnStatus label is
// the correct, non-hiding rendering here too.
